# ENG10-Group-Project
To save the code so everyone can see it you (might) need Git downloaded, and a github account.
Steps to get the repository:
    1) Click "code" the green button, and copy the link this should be it (git@github.com:Saa628/ENG10-Group-Project.git) but double check
    2) Open git bash (which is a terminal) or try using the regular terminal and navigate to a directory that you want to clone it in (using ls and cd commands, mkdir "name", if you want to create a directory)
    3) Type "git clone" followed by the url, >>> git clone git@github.com:Saa628/ENG10-Group-Project.git <<< it should look like that ignore the arrows
    4) Then you can open the file and make changes in jupyter or vscode or whatever you want to use.

Steps to save the file:
    1) Save like normal with ctrl + s
    2) Open the terminal again, navigate to the directory of the repository
    3) Type "git add .", then "git commit -m "any message you want" "
    4) Finally "git push", if this fails it probably means you don't have access, just dm me and i'll add you

If my instructions dont make any sense just search up how to clone a repo and it should work.
